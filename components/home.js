                        Hi, Iâ€™m Kailash, a final-year undergraduate computer science student at the National University of Singapore, expecting to graduate by May 2026.
                        While I am interested in all things computer science, my primary areas of interest are <b>back-end development</b> and <b>development in C++</b>.
                        I am also extremely passionate about <b>operating systems</b> and <b>parallel computing</b>, which are my areas of focus at NUS.

                        In the past, I have completed a number of software engineering internships at various companies. Apart from internships, I have worked on many technically challenging projects, including <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kaithanos/kaithanos">KaithanOS</a> (an operating system built from scratch) and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/janniver/interviewace">InterviewAce</a> (your very own AI technical interviewer), which I am eager to share. This website is a comprehensive portal about me, my projects, and my interests.

                        In my free time, I like to dabble in video game development and have created a number of games,
                        including <a target="_blank" href="https://kailash331215.itch.io/moneygame">
                            Money Tycoon
                        </a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://kailash331215.itch.io/tombgame">
                            Tomb of the Lost
                        </a>.
                        I am also an avid reader and enjoy reading books on technology and science fiction. And just like every other CS major, I kickstart my day with a hot cup of coffee!

                        This past summer, I interned at Goldman Sachs as a Software Engineer Intern under the Margin Engineering team.
                        I am currently interning at Squarepoint Capital as a C++ Software Engineer Intern under the Risk PnL team.
